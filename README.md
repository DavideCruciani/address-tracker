# IP Address Tracker

This project is a web application that allows users to geolocate an IP address. The application is developed using HTML, Tailwind CSS, React, TypeScript, and an API from Ipify (https://geo.ipify.org/) to fetch geolocation data and Leaflet (https://leafletjs.com/) for the interactive map.
